# SocialTravel
This is a social network created with PHP

This is a website that I created with my colleges Jordi Badia Iglesias and Arnau Cebrian d'Anguera, we used a Framework from our university, La Salle. The website is capable of:<br /><br />
1-SignUP new users<br />
2-SignIn for existing users<br />
3-Insert, update or delete Travels<br />
4-View all the travels or only your travels<br />
5-Make searches by hashtag<br />
6-Search users by Countries visited or by username<br />
7-Follow users<br />
8-Other actions to make the expirience more comfortable<br /><br />

This website can handle many types of exceptions such as incorrect characters in some inputs, avoiding in this way posible SQL injections. Also the navigation on it follows a very tidy and logical way, as you can see in the URL. Here are some of the screenshoots.
